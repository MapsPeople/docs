This guide explains how to start using a MapsIndoors map in your iOS application using the MapsIndoors iOS SDK v3.

To benefit from the guides, you will need basic knowledge about:

* iOS Development
* Google Maps iOS SDK

> Known Issues:
>
> 1. Developing on the new Arm-based (M1) Macs requires building and running on a physical iOS device or using an iOS simulator running iOS 13.7, e.g. iPhone 11. This is a temporary limitation in Google Maps SDK for iOS, and as such also a limitation in MapsIndoors, due to the dependency to Google Maps.
