In this tutorial, you build your own app from the ground up, gaining experience with the typical development process when working with the MapsIndoors SDK. Furthermore, you should be able to gain a basic understanding of the basic concepts, tools and terminology, commonly used when interacting with the SDK. The goal of this guide will be to leave you with an app, that is able to display a map and incorporate a few basic features such as searching, directions and live data integration.

### Take-Away Skills

* Display an interactive map with MapsIndoors
* Implementing search functionality to interact with the map
* Display directional aid between two points on the map
* (Incorporate Live Data into the map)
