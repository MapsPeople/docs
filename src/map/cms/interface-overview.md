Working left to right, the functionality in this main toolbar is as follows - You can also hover over the icons in the CMS to see their names.

* Add POI - Creates a Point of Interest where you click, and opens the configuration menu to add information to it.
* Add Area - Creates an Area by clicking to create corners of a polygon.
* Show Network - A toggle button to show or hide the route network your Directions feature will use.
* Add Normal Route Element - Creates a Route Element on your map - These would usually be used to create "invisible" barriers, by customising the Restrictions for the Route Element, for example, if you do not want your Directions to guide your visitors down a specific hallway, but there isn't a physical door present.
* Add Entry Point - Adds an Entry Point to your map, such as a door.
* Add Floor Connector - Adds a Floor Connector to your map, such as a staircase.
