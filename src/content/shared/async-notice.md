> Please note that data in MapsIndoors is loaded asynchronously. This results in behavior where data might not have finished loading if you call methods accessing it immediately after initializing MapsIndoors. Best practice is to set up `listeners` or `delegates` to inform of when data is ready. Please be aware of this when developing using the MapsIndoors SDK.
