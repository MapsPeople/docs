> Please note that data in MapsIndoors is loaded asynchronously. This results in behavior where things aren't finishing loading if you call them immediately after. Best practice is to set up a `listener` or `delegate` to inform of when data is ready. Please be aware of this when developing using the MapsIndoors SDK!
