All three return a list of Locations from your Solution matching the parameters they are given. The results are ranked upon the 3 following factors:

* If a "near" parameter is set, how close is the origin point to the result?
* How well does the search input text match the text of the result (using the "Levenshtein distance" algorithm)?
* Which kind of geodata is the result (e.g. Buildings are ranked over POIs)?

This means that the first item in the search result list will be the one matching the 3 factors best and so forth.
