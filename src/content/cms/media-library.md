## Feature List

### Uploading Files

Clicking the "Upload" button opens a local File Explorer window, allowing you to locate the file you wish to upload to the Media Library. If a file with the same name as the selected file already exists in the Media Library, a warning will show up. You may choose to cancel the upload, or to overwrite the existing file, but this will also replace all existing uses of the file with this name. `sampleimage.jpg` and `sampleimage.png` may both exist in the Media Library concurrently, but `sampleimage.jpg` and `SampleImage.jpg` will throw a warning, as this check is not case-sensitive.

### Sort

The "Sort" option in the filter-bar provides the option to sort the content of the Media Library alphabetically or by upload date, both ascending and descending. This provides the following options in a drop-down menu:

* File Name A-Z
* File Name Z-A
* Recently Uploaded
* Oldest Uploaded

Clicking on one of these options initiates the sort.

### Filters

Various filtering options have been built into the Media Library, to ensure that you have an easy time finding exactly the media you need.

#### Type Filter

The "Filter" option in the filter-bar opens a drop-down menu allowing you to select which file-type should be displayed. These are currently `.svg`, `.png` and `.jpg/.jpeg`. You can select more than one option. If no option is selected, content of all file types will be displayed.

#### MapsIndoors Filter

A secondary filter also exists, allowing you to sort between media that is user-uploaded, and media that MapsPeople has pre-loaded as default options. These MapsIndoors icons cannot be deleted, but using this filter you can opt to not have them displayed.
