Making MapsIndoors accessible to all is important to us at MapsPeople, and we go to great lengths to make sure you can build accessible apps using our SDKs.

We support building apps that are at least compliant with WCAG 2.0 AA using any of the MapsIndoors SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, and Android). Our SDKs also support screen readers such as Voiceover on iOS and TalkBack on Android.

However, it is important to note that compliance with e.g. WCAG is to some degree a subjective assessment. You will only be judged based on which of the WCAG criteria fit your app's specific use case. We offer our customers the ability to build apps that are (most often) centered around maps, so they are judged on that, not how you would evaluate a music player or news app.

### AAA Support

Technically, it is possible to build an app that is AAA compliant under the WCAG assessment, but most legal requirements focus on AA compliance, which is less specific on some points compared to AAA.

### VPAT

MapsPeople can provide an External Visually Impaired Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) upon request, which details the guidelines and compliance level related to each MapsIndoors SDK.
