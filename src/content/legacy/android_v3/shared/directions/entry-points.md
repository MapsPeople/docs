Entry Points are specified points in a MapsIndoors Venue that enable a transition between a global or regional map and the local map in MapsIndoors. The Entry Point often specify which travel modes are suitable for entering/exiting the Venue. There are four travel modes: *Walking*, *Bicycling*, *Driving* and *Transit* (Public Transportation). As such, the Entry Point may be a bike shed for the Bicycling travel mode, a carpark for Driving and a bus stop for Transit. As a consequence, it is often at the Entry Point that the Travel Mode changes from Bicycling, Driving or Transit to Walking. The selection of an entry point for transitioning between route networks is based on a combination of automatic calculation, estimation and optimisation.
