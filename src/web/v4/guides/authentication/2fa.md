## Enabling 2-Factor Authentication

Enabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) is done by the user themselves via the CMS. If a user clicks their avatar in the top-right corner, a drop-down menu will appear, where "Settings" should be clicked. The user should now follow the instructions to enable 2FA.

## Disabling 2FA

Once 2FA is enabled, this page will change to allow disabling of 2FA, should the user want to do this at a later point. Simply follow the instructions on the page.

If you, or a user, loses access to your account and are unable to use 2FA for any reason, please contact your representative at MapsPeople, and we will work with you to find a solution.
