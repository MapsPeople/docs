## Configuring POI translations in CMS

To provide multiple languages for items in the MapsIndoors CMS, such as "Meeting Room" or "Restroom", the translation must be provided by the user in the CMS. A translation can be provided in any language. In order to add non-default languages, please contact your MapsIndoors representative, and we will enable you to add translations in your desired language.

Once your language of choice has been created, you can add the translation by clicking on any POI, which will open a menu on the left side of the screen. Here, you will see the following menu point, where you can enter translations for the languages you wish. If a field is left empty, the fallback language is English. In the example below, English (en) and Danish (da) are the enabled languages.
