In this tutorial, you will build your own app from the ground up, gaining experience with the typical development process when working with the MapsIndoors SDK. Furthermore, you should be able to gain a basic understanding of the basic concepts, tools and terminology, commonly used when interacting with the SDK. The goal of this guide will be to leave you with an app, that is able to display a map and incorporate a few basic features such as searching, directions and Live Data integration.

The Live Data relies on a MapsIndoors Dataset which supports Live Data integration, if you do not have access to this we recommend using our demo API key: `{{sdk.tutorialAPIKey}}`.
