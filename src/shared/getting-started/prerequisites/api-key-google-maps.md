## Get Your Google Maps API key

First, you need to [setup at a new project in the Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) (**PLEASE NOTE:** You are going to need a Google Billing Account for this step). When the project is created, the following APIs and the specific SDK you plan to use must be enabled from the [Maps API Library Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?filter=category:maps).

* Google Maps Distance Matrix API
* Google Maps Directions API
* Google Places API Web Service
* Maps SDK for Android/iOS or Maps JavaScript API

When the above 3 APIs and the SDK are enabled, you can retrieve the API key from the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential). On the Credentials page, click *Create credentials* > *API key*.
