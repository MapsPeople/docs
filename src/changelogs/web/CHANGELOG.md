The MapsIndoors JavaScript SDK V4 can now be used with [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/). It introduces several **breaking changes**, so read this carefully.

### Added

#### Classes

mapView classes that acts as map library adapters (map creation and common interface) to MapsIndoors:

- `mapsindoors.mapView.GoogleMapsView`: mapView for Google Maps.
- `mapsindoors.mapView.MapboxView`: mapView for Mapbox GL JS.

#### Methods

- `mapsIndoors.getFilter()` returns the array of locations ids that the locations on the map are currently filtered by.

#### Events

- `venue_changed` event on MapsIndoors that fires if the venue changes after calling `mapsIndoors.setVenue()`.

### Changed

#### MapsIndoors class

Instantiation:

- Create an instance of a mapView, either `mapsindoors.mapView.GoogleMapsView` or `mapsindoors.mapView.MapboxView`.
- Then create an instance of MapsIndoors like this: `const mapsIndoors = new mapsindoors.MapsIndoors({mapView: mapViewInstance});`.

Methods:

- `setApiKey()` is renamed to `setMapsIndoorsApiKey()`.
- `getMapStyle()` is renamed to `getMapIndoorsStyle()`.
- `getMapStyles()` is renamed to `getMapIndoorsStyles()`.

#### Services

- All services (DistanceMatrixService, GeoCodeService, LocationsService, AppConfigService, DirectionsService, ShareService, SolutionsService, VenuesService) must now be accessed by the `mapsindoors.services` namespace, eg. `mapsindoors.services.AppConfigService`.

#### DirectionsService

- The class must now be instantiated and given an instance of en external directions provider, either `mapsindoors.directions.GoogleMapsProvider` or `mapsindoors.directions.MapboxProvider`.
- A route `Leg` now encompasses a part of a route until a change in floor level, no matter the travel mode.
- `Step.abutters` is changed to `Step.route_context`, and the value `OutsideOnVenue` is now always `Outside`.
- All steps from an external directions provider will have `routeContext` set to `Outside`.
- The route results (and the legs) now includes a `geometry` object that contains a GeoJSON LineString for the route or leg.

#### Directions renderer

- DirectionsRenderer class must now be accessed under the directions namespace, i.e. `mapsindoors.directions.DirectionsRenderer`.
- DirectionsRenderer no longer requires the map as a constructor parameter.

### Removed
