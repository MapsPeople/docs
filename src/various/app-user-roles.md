Application User Roles are a feature of the MapsIndoors where you can define roles that you can assign to your users. This will impact various features of the app, for example, if certain doors can only be accessed by employees, you could define an "Employee" and "Visitor" role, and when using the application to search for directions, users assigned to the "Visitor" role will be shown a different route that does not go through such doors, whereas "Employee" users will be shown directions that also include these doors.

## How to Configure App User Roles
App User Roles are confuigured via the CMS web application. In the menus, go to `Solution Details > App Settings > App Configuration`, and then find the menu point named `App User Roles`. Here, you can configure existing roles, and add new ones.

Upon clicking `Add App User Role`, you will be asked to enter the name of the newly created Role, in all defined languages for your solution.

## What Features do App User Roles Affect?
The App User Roles are a useful tool to limit which types of users can see certain Locations. The main fields that can be influenced through the App User Rules are the Locations on the Map itself, whether they show up in the Search, and how they influence the Directions.

### Directions
As mentioned previously, App User Roles can be used to determine which passages can be taken by a given role. Any Entrance defined on the map, in the menu, there is a section named `Restrictions`, where you are presented with options to customise which access options, for example limiting it to certain App User Roles.
