<p>Some locations in MapsIndoors can have additional polygon information. These polygons can be used to render a room or area in a special way or make geofences, calculating whether another point or location is contained within the polygon. If a <code>MPLocation</code> has polygons, these can be retrieved using the <code>MPGeometryHelper</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let polygons = MPGeometryHelper.polygonsForLocation(location : MPLocation)
let polygon = polygons.first
let path = polygon.path
let holes = polygon.holes
for coordinate in path {
    let lat = coordinate[1]
    let lng = coordinate[0]
}
</code></pre>
<p>As demonstrated above, a polygon's outer ring/path as well as holes are arranged as [longitude, latitude] pairs. As not all locations has polygons, the polygon array may be empty. On the contrary, some locations, like entire building floors, might have more than polygon.</p>
