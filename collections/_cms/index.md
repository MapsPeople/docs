## Introduction

The MapsIndoors Content Management System (CMS) allows you to maintain your data within the MapsIndoors platform.

Data is structured in a hierarchy where the top level is your solution which can contain multiple venues, which in turn can have multiple buildings and so on. The data-types in hierarchical order:

* Solution
* Venues
* Buildings
* Floors
* Locations (rooms and points of interest)

Although a point of interest can be placed within a room, it is not required. Points of interest can also be placed “outside” on the ground level which is also the layer where the Google map exists. In this case the POI belongs to the venue directly.

## Navigating the CMS

The panel on the left lets you navigate the CMS.

There are 2 different roles in the system:

* **Editor** - Editors can create new locations, make changes to and remove existing locations
* **Admin** - Administrators have editor rights and have access to icon settings and users

## The Map

After logging in, the map will appear.

To create a new POI, first make it clear if this is an outdoor POI or placed inside a Building. If inside a Building, select the desired building from the drop down menu. Click on the POI icon in the bottom right corner, then click on the map where it should be added. The placement doesn’t have to be 100% precise, it can be moved afterwards.

![New location](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide2.png)

After clicking on the box, you will be asked to select a location Type and Name. The other choices; Description, Categories, Icon are optional.

Select the icon on the map for the location that you wish to edit, or click on Locations in the main navigation and then choose “View List”. From there you can choose which location you would like to edit by clicking on the pencil icon.

In the Edit Location Form you can do the following:

**Location Type:** This can be changed by clicking on the drop down menu with location types.

**Name:** Enter a new name if you want to change the name of the location. You also have the option of adding another language.

**Description:** Provide a description of the location. 
There is an option to add more information for this location. This can be done by clicking on Location type templates in the main navigation. From there you can add specific fields to a location type, those fields will then appear in the location form.

**Categories:** Set/change what category it belongs to.

**Icon Settings:** Change the Icon associated with the location. An icon can be chosen from the library or an icon can be uploaded. Use square images in .png format, 40x40 pixels, or 20x20 - as lower screen resolutions will use this size.

**Image:** An image can be uploaded.

**Google Street View:** It can be enabled for the web app at a location by setting a Street View image matching that location.
Google Street View must be available in the building.

1. Click “Set Street View image” 
  - This will open a Google Street View window showing an image closest to this location. In the case an outside image is shown it can be because Google Street View is not available in your building - you need to check that with your organisation or examine using Google maps.
1. Navigate Street View and find an image and viewing angle that is suitable
1. Click “Set image”

## Routes Access

![Routes](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide5.png)

This is a list of all the location types in the solution. From this list you can edit each location by clicking on the pencil.

**Location type templates**
Locations inherit templates from their types. These templates allow you to set up custom data fields. Note that these templates only add the properties. To display or otherwise use a property the app needs to be customized. Standard app users will not be able to use the properties.

## Categories

![Categories](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide7.png)

Ability to add new categories to the list. Click on New category, add name, click save. Once created, this category can be added to a specific location type. The categories can be chosen to be displayed in the app, as well as put in a specific order (this can be done under App Configuration).

## Type visibility

Use these settings to control how Icons are shown on the map

**Zoom Level:** This can be edited by moving the dot on the line. The icon will appear in the chosen zoom level

**Visible:** By clicking the eye, this will remove the icon from appearing in the solution

## Users

A list appears with all users for the solution. You can also search for an email via the search box in the upper right.

**New user:** Click on new user bottom at top. Enter email, choose Editor or Administrator, and assign the appropriate solution. Click Create.

## Logs

The Audit Log functionality is a configurable feature in MapsIndoors and if not enabled on your solution it can be on request.

The Audit Log feature can be used to access the Audit log on MapsIndoor data objects, i.e. you can find or inspect the change history.

The Log functionality is found in the Log menu point in the left menu of the MapsIndoors CMS.

![Audit log](https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide9.png)

The Log can be filtered on date, ID, User and Data object types. When pressing download a comma separated file (csv) will be stored on your computer's hard drive.

The log will be in CSV format, which can be opened by a spreadsheet program eg. Excel. Each log entry represents a modification in the data. In short, each entry tells at what time who did what to which object.

The headers represented are:
Time, User, Action, ObjectType, ObjectId and ObjectData

- **Time:** Tells which user did the change (The email representing the user logged in to the system)
- **Action:** Tells what happened: 
  - If data was added, the 'Action' will be set to 'Created'
  - If data was changed, the 'Action' will be set to 'Changed'
  - If data was deleted, the 'Action' will be set to 'Deleted'
- **ObjectType:** Tells what type of data was modified (eg. ‘building’, ‘location’, ‘user’, ‘graphdata’ ... )
- **ObjectId:** Is a unique ID that represents the given data - building, location or whatever it is. 
If you want to see a history of that specific location this ID can be used to filter by
- **ObjectData:** Is a JSON formatted representation of the actual data stored in the Mapsindoors system. To see what changed you can compare this data to the previous change.

Examples of use cases could be:

* **How to do I get Network history?** Filter the ObjectType to ‘graphdata’’ to see these entries. To find a particular user history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.
* **How to do I get Categories history?** Filter the ObjectType to ‘category’ to see these entries. To find a particular data history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.
* **How to do I get Location type/type template/visibility history?** Filter the ObjectType to ‘locationtype’ to see these entries. To find a particular data history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well. The type template is covered in the “LocationTypeField” section of the data. The visibility is covered in the “displayrule” section of the data
* **How to find user login activity?** When a user logs in, the corresponding user object will be changed too (the ‘last login field will be updated’). Filter the ObjectType to ‘user’ to see login entries. To find a particular user login history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.

If you use Excel you can find a video on how to open a CSV file here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Pxil4jVO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Pxil4jVO4)

* **Icons:** Icons are used for various Locations on the map, e.g. POIs, Rooms. Having a unified representation for specific types of locations makes the system easier for users to engage with.
* **Location**: A term used for all Rooms and points of interest (POI).
* **POI**: “Point of interest” - is usually an object that isn’t tied to a room. E.g. Vending Machine, Locker, A Statue, ATM etc.
* **Type**: All locations are of a type. Types serve as templates for locations to provide a basic setup. Many of the properties can later be overridden for specific locations.
* **Venue**: Typically a collection of buildings that are close geographically.
* **Search alias**: An alternative name for a location allowing users to search for the location by that name.
